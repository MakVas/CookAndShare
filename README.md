"Cook&Share" is an application that generates a variety of recipes for cooking from the foods that are in the user's refrigerator. The goal of the project is to make life easier and increase comfort and convenience for users, maintain its relevance and promote its development.

The project is presented in the form of an application for mobile devices that can be downloaded to the appropriate device. Users are people who are interested in cooking recipes.
It is worth noting that this is a kind of social network where people will post only cooking recipes or look for something interesting instead of photos and videos from their personal lives. This way, you can create a convenient community of true food lovers or learn something new about the cuisine of other countries.
